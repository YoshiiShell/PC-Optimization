It all starts with the hardware. 

If you're planning to follow this from an existing Windows installation, move onto Optimizations.md

## CPU

Not really much to say about CPU other than "go for what your budget is." 

However if you're planning to use your computer for specialized things such as weather programs, virtual machines, or graphically demanding programs, prioritize amount of cores slightly more. 

## Memory

Try to use either two or four sticks of RAM.

This brings it into dual-channel mode. Which is better performance wise.

Avoid memory sticks with RGB as that takes up needed power.

## Disk

For the main Windows installation, go for an SSD. If you have the budget, go for a nice M.2 SSD.

If you need extra disks for general storage, go for high-RPM HDDs. Especially if you need to keep the storage for a long time.

## Cooling

Place your fans so that outside air goes in and inside air goes out.

Make sure your fans or water cooling sets don't have any RGB.

## Power

Make sure your PSU doesn't have any RGB.

Your PSU should be 500-800 watts above what you need. Especially if you're planning to overclock.

## GPU

iGPUs aren't horrible, however for the best experience go for a dedicated GPU.

Make sure your cables connecting your computer to your monitor go to the motherboard.

Make sure nothing else bottlenecks the GPU. 
If you have a high tier GPU and mid tier everything else, the GPU will run mid tier

Make sure there is no RGB on the GPU.

## Peripherals

Prefer wired over wireless peripherals.

Make sure there is no RGB on the peripherals.

Always connect your peripherals to the slowest USB 3.0 ports
