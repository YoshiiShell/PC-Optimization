# Dual channel memory

RAM brings it's contents to the CPU to be processed. In one or three sticks of memory, there is only one line, a bus.
When two or four are in however, dual-channel memory is on, which adds another bus, doubling the space from 64 bit space to 128 bit space.
The performance gains are noticable and is highly recommended.
