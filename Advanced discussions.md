# Dual channel memory

RAM brings it's contents to the CPU to be processed. In one or three sticks of memory, there is only one line, a bus.
When two or four are in however, dual-channel memory is on, which adds another bus, doubling the space from 64 bit space to 128 bit space.
The performance gains are noticable and is highly recommended.

# My attack on RGB

I don't like RGB from a pure optimization standpoint. It takes power (even if minimal) away from what you need, and is just yet another thing you have to handle. 
In my opinion, sleeper builds are best for performence, although I am biased (I have an older sleeper build)
