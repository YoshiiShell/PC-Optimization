You might be asking "How would I optimize my PC?" Well, it depends what exactly you're going for.

Do you want privacy from the spying eyes at Microsoft or Google? Do you want pure performance? Do you want have the most minimalist install ever?

Well I will at least attempt to help on every one of those.

Through this we will be going over hardware, your operating system, what programs I recommend, and answer questions people might have.

Even debunk old myths people are believing. Now time to go through the journey of PC Optimizations
