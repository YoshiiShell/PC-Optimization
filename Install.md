Let's install Windows! You have two options. Either through a USB stick or through InstallWindowsWithoutUSB.

### If you're planning to follow this from an existing Windows installation, move onto Optimizations.md. If you are planning to dual boot with an optimized Windows, follow this.

## USB

If you have a USB stick (formally known as a mass storage device), use [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v4.5/rufus-4.5.exe) to flash it on the USB.

You should then restart the system. During boot, spam the BIOS key or the boot order key. usually F2, 12 or del. Boot to the USB and you should be at the Windows install screen.

## InstallWindowsWithoutUSB

Yes, you can install Windows without a USB stick and I'd say it's better than a USB in fact. Click on [this to download the program](https://github.com/iidanL/InstallWindowsWithoutUSB/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the ZIP.

Then run the batchfile as administrator and follow the instructions. Then reboot and you should be at windeploy.

# Installing Windows pre-OOBE

## USB

For region, choose "World" then change nothing and follow instructions. After it reboots, you will have to wait for Windeploy. 

## all

Now both types of users should be at Windeploy. Now wait for OOBE.

Tired so I'll do more later
