We got the hardware! Let's get the operating system now. But before that we have to do a few things.

### If you're planning to follow this from an existing Windows installation, move onto Optimizations.md

## BIOS updates

The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is what boots the computer and the hardware behind it. It also loads the "Bootloader" of your operating system.

This BIOS can be updated in a couple ways. However the easiest (excluding updating it after OS installation) is through a flash update on a USB stick.

I'd recommend updating through OS unless you need to do it before. Like if your CPU is unsupported without a BIOS update. In this case:

### Do this only if you are comfortable to do this!

On a different computer go to your computer's or motherboard's website and grab a BIOS file or installer which should contain it.

Put it on a FAT-32 formatted USB stick and put it into your new computer.

Open the BIOS by spamming either the F2, F10, F12 or DEL key. If none of those work, check the computer's or motherboard provider's manual.

The BIOS update flash can be in various different spots within the BIOS menu. However most of the time its either on the first screen, has it's own section, or is in an advanced section.

It has various different names. 

ASRock: Instant Flash

Asus: EZ Flash or EZ Flash 3

Gigabyte: Q-Flash

MSI: M-Flash

Now select the only file (if there is multiple, make sure there is **one** .rom. If not, cancel out and troubleshoot.

Let it update and once it does, it will restart you back to BIOS, or restart normally. Which then you should see Windowson a prebuilt, or a no OS found error on a custom-built.
