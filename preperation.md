We got the hardware! Let's get the operating system now. But before that we have to do a few things.

### If you're planning to follow this from an existing Windows installation, move onto Optimizations.md

## BIOS updates

The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is what boots the computer and the hardware behind it. It also loads the "Bootloader" of your operating system.

This BIOS can be updated in a couple ways. However the easiest (excluding updating it after OS installation) is through a flash update on a USB stick.

### Do this only if you are comfortable to do this!

Open the BIOS by spamming either the F2, F10, F12 or DEL key. If none of those work, check the computer's or motherboard provider's manual.

The BIOS update flash can be in various different spots within the BIOS menu. However most of the time its either on the first screen, has it's own section, or is in an advanced section.

It has various different names. 

ASRock: Instant Flash
Asus: EZ Flash or EZ Flash 3
Gigabyte: Q-Flash
MSI: M-Flash
